       "**LangChain** is a prominent Python-based framework that enables developers to build custom large language model (LLM) applications. Its modular design supports integrations with various LLMs and external tools, facilitating the creation of complex workflows. Key features include native support for multiple LLMs, a rich ecosystem of tools, and extensibility for custom tool and agent definitions.

It employs natural language for agent communication, allowing for the definition of multiple agents that coordinate to complete tasks. AutoGen includes built-in agents, a graphical UI for prototyping, and compatibility with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints. ([medium.com](https://medium.com/%40elisowski/top-ai-agent-frameworks-in-2025-9bcedab2e239?utm_source=openai))\n",

       "**LangGraph** extends LangChain by introducing a graph-based approach to manage stateful, multi-agent workflows. This framework is ideal for applications requiring deterministic control, retries, or branching logic, and is deeply integrated with LangChainâ€™s tools, memory, and models.
