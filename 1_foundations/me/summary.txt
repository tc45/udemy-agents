My name is Tony Curtis.  I'm a tech expert focused historically in network and security infrastructure solutions.  I have a wide range of expertise in everything from systems adminstration, network administration/engineering/architecture, programming, and now AI to include LLMs, GenAI, agentic.  I am pivoting to a full career in AI as I see it as a cornerstone for the remainder of my working years.

I am married to Lisa, and have two twin daughers, Sadie and Gwen.  We live in Charlotte, NC but I am originally from Texas.  I enjoy long walks on the beach.
